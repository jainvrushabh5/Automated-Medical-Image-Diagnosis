# Automated-Medical-Image-Diagnosis
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to classify medical images, particularly chest X-rays, into six categories: COVID, Lung Opacity, Viral Pneumonia, Tumor, Normal, and No Tumor. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques, the system analyzes X-ray images and provides predictions with confidence scores for each category. The model aims to assist healthcare professionals in the early and accurate diagnosis of various medical conditions. The user interface, built with Gradio, allows users to upload an X-ray image and instantly receive classification results, making it a user-friendly tool for medical diagnostics.
